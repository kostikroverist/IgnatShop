## Ignat Sport Store Documentation

Welcome to the Ignat Sport Store project! Below is a brief overview of the project structure and its main components.

### Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React application setup:

- `src/`: This directory contains all the source code for the application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.
  - `layouts/`: Contains layout components that structure the overall page layout.
  - `pages/`: Contains individual page components that are rendered by React Router.
  - `style/`: Contains SCSS files for styling the application.
- `public/`: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, and icons.

### Main Components



1. **Layout Component:**
   - A layout component has been implemented to provide a consistent structure across different pages of the application. This layout can be easily extended to accommodate future enhancements.

2. **Slider Component:**
   - The project features three working sliders implemented using the `Slider` library. These sliders provide interactive content presentation to users.

3. **Custom Button Component:**
   - A custom button component has been created, featuring default and dark themes. This button enhances the user interface and maintains consistency across the application.
